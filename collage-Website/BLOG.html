    <h1>TESTIMONIAL</h1>
    <p>I would like to thank all our placement department for their fantastic support by conducting placement training and providing online training too.
        Md. Shahadat, Former Student, Computer Technology
        
        I definitely would recommend SIPI and would encourage students to study hard and inform themselves as much as possible about the several academic opportunities the Institution offers.‚Äù
        Farjana Haque, Former Student, Electronic Technology
        
        This institution is worth applying because the faculty really puts a lot of effort into students. When a student has a problem, the teacher would walk to their desk and help the student.

                    <p>This institute is the best place to study due to several reasons. Firstly, it provides with all the resources needed to learn, grow, and increase knowledge in your area of study. Secondly, teachers, who are truly professionals, are willing to spend extra time to explain material if something was unclear, and are always available during the office hours.thirdly, students are highly motivated,energetic, and they study independently for long hours. Being in such environment, I am constantly reminded that I have the power to achieve my goals through diligence and determination.</p>
